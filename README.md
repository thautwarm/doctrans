# doctrans
Transform markdown to rst, and so on. A `smarter` text processing tool than pandoc in some areas.


# Note

The reason for making `doctrans` is that `pandoc` usually does not work when transfroming markdown to rst.


# Note++

This repo would be developed slowly because I'm quite busy with my daily tasks.
